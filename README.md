# CBottle
CBottle is a project for the seminar course 'Computer Vision by Deep Learning'. The project is made to
identify bottles in an image and map them to a certain SKU based on the wine webshop. 

### Environmental details:

The entirety of the project relies on a dataset that is only made available to the collaborators
and located in the environment settings. It should not be possible to run this OOTB but can be used to gain
inspiration.

This project was ran with:

```
GPU: RTX 3080
CPU: i5 9600k
OS: Ubuntu 20.4
CUDA: 11
```

The Ubuntu environment was bootstrapped using [lambda stack](https://lambdalabs.com/lambda-stack-deep-learning-software)
to have the latest version of the required software/drivers.
